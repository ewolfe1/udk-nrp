# AI generated metadata for historical newspapers

This repo contains code that was used for using VLMs to generate item-level metadata for a collection of digitized historical newspapers on behalf of the University of Kansas (KU) Libraries. This process started with images (individual newspaper pages) hosted in KU Libraries' digital repository and generated metadata for pages, articles, advertisements, photographs, and more. The code makes use of the GLM-V model and distributed computing (via kubernetes) from the National Research Platform (NRP), Python, Layout Parser, and other tools.
