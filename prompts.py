This is an automated crop of the top 15% of a digitized newspaper page from microfilm (1878-2017). Clarity varies. Formatting and style vary significantly across eras. The supplied date range is estimated guidance, not ground truth. No guarantee any requested elements are present.
</context>

<process>
1. Scan header systematically (top to bottom, left to right)
2. Identify visible page-level metadata
3. Format as valid JSON per template below

# item level metadata
def item_prompt():

<task>Analyze digitized pages from The University Daily Kansan (University of Kansas student newspaper) to create an index of page contents with descriptive metadata for each item. Do NOT itemize or describe advertisements, classifieds, comic strips, puzzles/games - these will get a single aggregate entry as described in item_identification.</task>

<critical_rules>
- Base ALL metadata on visible content only—read each item carefully before creating metadata
- category MUST exactly match a value from <categories> (no variations)
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no wrapper tags, commentary, or special tokens like <think>)
- Start response with opening brace {
- Use exact title transcription or [bracketed descriptions]
- Do NOT itemize advertisements, classifieds, comic strips, or puzzles — use single aggregate entries: "[advertisements]", "[classifieds]", "[comic strips]", "[puzzles/games]"
- Use lower confidence when uncertain rather than inventing content
- Omit fields entirely rather than using empty/null values
</critical_rules>

<context>
Digitized from microfilm (1878-2017) with variable clarity. Formatting, style, and historical context vary significantly. Early issues may lack traditional headlines—review all text blocks thoroughly. Supplied date is OCR-generated guidance, not ground truth.
</context>

<process>
1. Scan entire page systematically (top to bottom, left to right)
2. Identify all distinct content items before creating entries
3. For each item, extract: category (from list), title (transcribe or [bracket]), subject terms, named_entities (if present), summary, and confidence score
4. Format as valid JSON per template
</process>

<item_identification>
Combine related elements (headline + article + photo = ONE item; category heading with multiple short articles = ONE item).

Boundary examples:
- Headline + body + related photo = ONE item
- Standalone photo unrelated to text = ONE item
- Two separate side-by-side articles = TWO items
- Multi-topic roundup column = ONE item (use general heading as title)

Standalone photos with captions: treat as separate items titled "Photo: [transcribe caption]"

Mastheads are not items unless they contain news content. If unsure about boundaries, combine rather than split.
</item_identification>

<metadata_fields>
- **category**: MUST be exactly one value from the <categories> list below.
  Copy the exact string—do not paraphrase or create variations. (required)
- **title**: Transcribe headlines/titles exactly as printed. If no title exists, create [descriptive title in brackets]. For aggregate entries use: "[advertisements]", "[classifieds]", "[comic strips]", "[puzzles/games]" (required)
- **subject**: 2-5 broad descriptive terms for content topics (not people/places). Use Library of Congress FAST subject headings when you recognize applicable terms; otherwise use clear, standard terminology. Pipe-delimited: "item1|item2|item3" (required)
- **named_entities**: Notable persons or locations when present; format as "Last, First" or "Last, First [role]" if explicit. Pipe-delimited. (Include if present; omit generic terms like "KU" or "universities")
- **summary**: 10-30 word content description (required if high confidence; omit for ads/classifieds/low-confidence items)
- **confidence**: Score for this item's metadata (0.0-1.0, required)
