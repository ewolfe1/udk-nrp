<task_overview>Analyze this image to extract page-level metadata from the header of digitized newspaper pages when possible</task_overview>

<critical_rules>
- Base ALL metadata exclusively on visible content in the image
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no wrapper tags, no commentary)
- Use exact title transcription or [bracketed descriptions]
- When uncertain, use lower confidence scores rather than inventing content
- Omit fields entirely rather than using empty/null values
</critical_rules>

<instructions>
<image_context>
- This image is an automated crop of the top 15% of a digitized newspaper page. There is no guarantee that any of the requested elements will be present.
- This newspaper was digitized from microfilm and may have variation in clarity. Publication dates range from 1878 to 2017, so the formatting, layout, and style will vary significantly.
- The supplied date range is estimated and should be used as guidance and not as ground truth.
</image_context>

<step_by_step_process>
1. Scan the entire header systematically (top to bottom, left to right)
2. Identify the page-level metadata requested.
3. Review the page again and verify that only visible metadata has been collected and that it is accurate.
4. Format results according to the JSON template.
5. Validate the JSON to ensure it is valid and does not contain extraneous tags, text, or elements.
</step_by_step_process>

<metadata_fields>
- **paper**: The title of the newspaper as printed.
- **date**: Publication date as printed. Format as "YYYY-MM-DD". If only partial date visible/legible, use available precision (e.g., "1885-03" or "1885")
- **page**: Page number of the current image. Integer.
- **volume**: Volume of the paper. Return as an integer, regardless of formatting. Examples: "Vol. 32"=32; "Vol. LII"=52; "23rd year"=23
- **number**: Number of the paper. Return as an integer. Example: "No. 4"=4
- **section**: A distinct thematic section of the paper. Usually printed near the very top in a larger font. Examples: "Campus Life", "Sports"
- **confidence**: Overall confidence score for the extracted metadata (0.0-1.0). Always include.
</metadata_fields>

<error_handling>
- If any element cannot be confidently identified, omit from the JSON.
- If there is no pertinent data found in this image segment, it may be due to source formatting. Do not create results that are not present. Return the approprate option:
    - No metadata elements: {"error": "no_page_metadata_found", "confidence": (0.0-1.0)}
    - Illegible text: {"error": "illegible_image", "confidence": (0.0-1.0)}
</error_handling>

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
- Returning strings for page/volume/number instead of integers
- Inventing dates when only partial information is visible
- Using modern date formats instead of YYYY-MM-DD
- Including low-confidence fields instead of omitting them
</common_mistakes_to_avoid>
</instructions>

<confidence_guidelines>
- 0.9-1.0: All identified metadata elements clearly visible and unambiguous
- 0.7-0.89: Most elements clear, minor uncertainty about category or details
- 0.5-0.69: Significant text damage or ambiguous content type
- 0.0-0.49: Highly uncertain; severe damage or unclear context
</confidence_guidelines>

<verification_checklist>
Before finalizing each item, confirm:
- Each metadata element is present in the image
- All present requested metadata elements have been captured in the metadata
- Confidence reflects actual certainty (1) about identified content and (2) that missing elements are not present
</verification_checklist>
<output_format>
Return only valid JSON matching these template examples, including only metadata with high confidence:

<json_template>
    {"paper":"University Times",
    "page": 1,
    "date": "1906-07-23",
    "volume": 36,
    "number": 4,

<json_template>
    {"page": 4,
    "date": "1963-02-05",
    "confidence": 0.82
    }
</json_template>

<json_requirements>
- All string values must be quoted
- Dates must use "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
- Omit fields entirely if no value is confidently identified
- Do not use null or empty strings
- Return only the JSON object, no additional text or commentary
- Do not wrap the JSON in any tags or special tokens (e.g., <think>, <|end_of_box|>, etc.)
- Start your response directly with the opening brace {
- Ensure JSON is properly formatted and valid

<task_overview>Perform a detailed visual and textual analysis to review digitized pages from The University Daily Kansan (the student newspaper published by the University of Kansas), to create an index of the page contents (excluding advertisements and classifieds), with descriptive metadata for each item.</task_overview>

<critical_rules>
- Base ALL metadata exclusively on visible content in the image
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no wrapper tags, no commentary)
- Use exact title transcription or [bracketed descriptions]
- When uncertain, use lower confidence scores rather than inventing content
- Omit fields entirely rather than using empty/null values

<image_context>This newspaper was digitized from microfilm and may have variation in clarity. Publication dates range from 1878 to 2017, so the formatting/layout, style, and historical context will vary.</image_context>

<instructions>

<priority_instruction>
- Read each item carefully when generating metadata. Do not assume contents. All metadata must be based completely on the text in the image.
</priority_instruction>

<metadata_guidelines>
- Review each page in detail to extract descriptive metadata for each item on each page.
- Do not return individual entries for advertisements or classified.
- Take into account historical context when creating metadata elements (e.g., changes in language, social expectations, etc.). For example, early issues may not have traditional headlines in large/bold font - large blocks of text should be reviewed and held to the same high standard as other content.
- Unless it is a direct transcription, use "KU" for "University of Kansas"
- The entire collection is from the University of Kansas; do not include "KU" or other generic terms (e.g., "universities") as a subject or named_entity
- Note that the supplied date has been OCR generated and should be used as guidance, not as ground truth.
</metadata_guidelines>

<step_by_step_process>
1. Scan the entire page systematically (top to bottom, left to right)
2. Carefully review entire page to identify all content items before creating entries.
3. Identify all distinct content items regardless of size, length, or formatting
4. For each item, extract the required metadata elements
5. Review the page again and verify no items were missed - add additional items as necessary. Each page should have at least one item described on it. Some pages may have only one item (e.g., full page advertisements) or even be blank.
6. Format results according to the JSON template.
7. Validate the JSON to ensure it is valid and does not contain extraneous tags, text, or elements.
</step_by_step_process>

<item_identification>
- Combine related elements (headline + article body + photo caption = one item ; general category heading describing multiple short articles = one item)
<boundary_examples>
- Headline + article body + related photo = ONE item
- Standalone photo seemingly unrelated to textual content = ONE item
- Two separate articles side-by-side = TWO items
- Multi-topic roundup column = ONE item (use general heading as title)
</boundary_examples>
- If unsure about item boundaries, err on the side of combining rather than splitting content
- Treat standalone photos with captions as separate items: "Photo: [transcribe caption]"
- **Do not itemize these specific categories of content**: advertisements, classifieds, comic strips, puzzles/games. If a page contains any of these content types, include a single aggregate entry per type using bracketed titles: "[advertisements]", "[classifieds]", "[comic strips]", "[puzzles/games]". Example: A page with 3 news articles and 5 ads would have 3 individual article entries plus 1 "[advertisements]" entry.
- Mastheads and publication information are not items unless they contain news content
</item_identification>

<metadata_fields>
- **category**: Choose one primary descriptor from <categories> list (Required)
- **title**: **Transcribe exactly**; use [descriptive title in brackets] if none exists (Required)
- **subject**: list of 2-5 descriptive terms; use FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) subject headings when possible; focus on topics, not people or places. Format multiple values as a pipe-delimited string: 'item1|item2'  (Required)
- **named_entities**: list of named entities (notable persons or locations) when present; proper names should be formatted as "Last, First"; add [role] if explicit: "Last, First [role]". Format multiple values as a pipe-delimited string: 'item1|item2' (Include if present).
- **summary**: 10-30 word content description. (Required, if high confidence. Omit for advertisements, classifieds, and for low-confidence items.)
- **confidence**: Confidence score for this item's metadata (0.0-1.0). Example: 0.85,
</metadata_fields>

<category_classification>
- **national news**: Events and issues affecting the nation or international community
- **local news**: News about the broader local community beyond campus (city, county, region)
- **campus news**: News primarily affecting students, faculty, staff, or university operations
- **features/profiles**: Human interest stories, in-depth profiles, student life pieces, lifestyle content
- **editorial**: Institutional voice of the newspaper/editorial board (typically unsigned or signed by "Editorial Board")
- **opinion**: Individual columnist or contributor presenting personal viewpoint (bylined opinion pieces, op-eds)
- **letter**: Reader submission to the editor
- **sports**: Sports news, game coverage, athlete profiles, team updates
- **arts**: Arts news, artist profiles, arts scene coverage, cultural event reporting
- **reviews**: Evaluative criticism of specific works (films, music, books, performances, restaurants)

- **editorial cartoon**: Political/social commentary cartoons addressing current events or issues
- **comic strips**: Serialized entertainment comics with recurring characters or standalone gags
- **photos/graphics**: Standalone visual content not primarily illustrating an adjacent article
- **informational content**: Weather, PSAs, advice columns, reference material, service information
- **puzzles/games**: Crosswords, sudoku, word games, brain teasers
- **advertisements**: Display ads with graphics, designed layouts, business-purchased space
- **classifieds**: Text-based small ads (jobs, housing, personal ads, items for sale)
- **other**: Content not fitting above categories (mastheads, corrections, tables of contents)

<special_cases_and_error_handling>
<layout_issues>
- **Blank pages/Cover pages**: Some images may fall into this category. Treat them as such and create a single entry in JSON output.
- **Non-newspaper layouts**: Some images are in a journal format, rather than a standard newspaper layout. Treat pages considering their actual layout - do not try to force a format on them.
- **Photo spreads**: Each captioned photo = separate item
- **Continued articles**: Use title from first page; note "continued from/to page X" in summary. Only include when this is clearly present - do not make guesses.
- **Multi-column layouts**: Treat as single item if continuous text
- **Multiple items with identical titles**: When a page has multiple items with the same title (e.g., several "Letter to the Editor" submissions), include the title verbatim for each and differentiate in summaries.
</layout_issues>

<image_and_source_quality>
- **Damaged text**: Use [illegible] or [partially visible] in transcriptions
- **Illegible**: If page is completely illegible, return: {"error": "page_unreadable", "reason": "poor image quality"}
- **Obscured page**: If the page has an overlay partially covering the main contents (e.g., advertising insert), describe the overlay itself. Omit the remainder of the page.
</image_and_source_quality>

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
- Splitting single articles into multiple items (headline + body + photo = ONE item)
- Itemizing ads, classifieds, comics, or puzzles individually (use single aggregate entry per type)
- Inventing content not visible in the image
- Using article-specific details as subjects instead of broad topics
- Assuming modern newspaper format for historical issues (early papers often lack headlines)
- Including bylines, mastheads, or generic "KU" terms as named entities
- Miscategorizing reader letters as "opinion" (use "letter" category)
</common_mistakes_to_avoid>
</special_cases_and_error_handling>

<verification_checklist>
Before finalizing each item, confirm:
- Title exists verbatim in the image (or is bracketed descriptor)

<metadata_fields>
- **advertiser**: the party responsible for the ad, such as a business, organization, student group, etc. Be careful about misidentifying sponsors as advertisers. For example, as a retailer (advertiser) that includes the logo of a clothing brand (not the advertiser).
- **address**: the address of the primary advertiser, as printed
- **phone**: the phone number of the primary advertiser, as printed. Format modern numbers as ###-#### or ###-###-####
- **category**: Choose one top-level key from <categories> (e.g., "entertainment", "food & beverage")
- **subcategory**: Choose one value from the list associated with your selected **category** to help refine the classification. If the ad is "Not an advertisement", leave subcategory blank.
- **keywords**: 1-5 broad descriptive terms (focus on general themes rather than specific details). Format multiple values as a pipe-delimited string: 'item1|item2'.
- **summary**: 5-20 word content description. (Omit if low-confidence)
- **confidence**: numeric confidence score for this item's metadata (0.0 - 1.0). Example: 0.85
</metadata_fields>

<metadata_rules>
- **Priority instruction**: Do not make any assumptions about any of the metadata elements. Only create metadata that is provable by the image and/or OCR text.
- Ambiguous ads: Choose the category that represents the primary/emphasized service. If no category can be confidently identfied, use "Other" with no subcategory.
- Multiple organizations/services: Consider the focus of the ad itself. For example, use "Campus Events" if the event is the focus, "Campus Organizations" if recruiting/promoting the organization itself.
